# myFirstTest
This is a Test I conducted myself for my Beginnings in Coding.
If you Have any changes to have it Can be improved, Send it!
It is a Simple Input program using the basic Def, List, & Statements.

# Updates
I will work on this for about 1 once a week, until it's shortened or Greatly improved.


# To Run. (This is to help me Remember Im a Rabbits Tail.)
I do need to Edit this, But Im tired rn, I will in 4 hours.
Since this was made in Python 3.10, It would be best to run it as:

python3 finalProductforEarlyChapters.py

after Loading for a few seconds, the Terminal should print this:
  
  Welcome to Remind-a-pet! Please follow the Instructions!
 
 First, Please input the Amount of animals you Have
  
  # Known Issues
  After Input of Breeds, You will need to hit enter once more to recieve the final printout. I Will try to Fix this at a point
